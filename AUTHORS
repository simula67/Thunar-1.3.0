The tdb library, which is included with the Thunar distribution, was originally
written as part of the Samba suite. My understanding is that the majority of
the code was written by Andrew Trigell <tridge@linuxcare.com> with the help of
Paul "Rusty" Russell <rusty@linuxcare.com>. Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton
<luke@samba.org> also contributed a few patches. Sorted freelist merge code
added by Jeremy Allison <jeremy@valinux.com>.

The stock_folder-copy and stock_folder-move icons where taken from 
gnome-icon-theme 2.18.0 whose authors are Lapo Calamandrei <calamandrei@gmail.com>,
Rodney Dawes <dobey@novell.com>, Luca Ferretti <elle.uca@libero.it>,
Tuomas Kuosmanen <tigert@gimp.org>, Andreas Nilsson <nisses.mail@home.se>
and Jakub Steiner <jimmac@novell.com>. The icons are licensed under GPL.
